To run the models you must:

1 Copy the files to a local (cloud) folder;
2 Open the R project "ZIdispersal.Rproj" (it is highly recommended to use RStudio);
3 In R, you can open the file
  "Applied_models.R" (available in the tab "Files")
  OR
  "Simulated_models.R" (available in the tab "Files")
The first runs the applied models and the second the simulated.

4 Regardless which one (i.e., simulated or applied), first execute the data generation and then the models;

Note that several folders were created:
-Output: Stores the datasets generated and the results of the simulations models;
-Figure_weibull: Stores the figures of the simulated ZIWeibull model;
-Tables_weibull: Stores the tables generated in the ZIWeibull model;
-Figure_gamma: Stores the figures of the simulated ZIGamma model;
-Tables_gamma: Stores the tables generated in the ZIGamma model;
-Figure_applied: Stores the figures for both ZIGamma and ZIWeibull models for the applied part;
-Tables_applied: Stores the tables for both ZIGamma and ZIWeibull models for the applied part.
